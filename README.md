Conservation gap analysis workflow, created to be accompanied by the Conservation Gap Analysis Methodology User Guide (internal document of The Morton Arboretum; available to collaborators upon request); taught during June 2023 training sessions led by me, Emily Bruns, and funded by The Morton Arboretum.
